# Final-Project
Part 1
Snow Barreler is a fun game inspired by Frogger with a modern feel. 
Speed across an open snow terrain to the finish line and collect coins to accumulate point, collect them all and be the best!
Be aware this terrain is filled with traps!

Part 2
• Specific goals for this project is to create a functional game that allows the user to play
• Successful use of the Ps Play library
• Allow the user to play the game continuously

Part 3:
My inspiration:
• Flappy Bird Game: https://flappybird.io/
• Bjork Saves Universe: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/490132
• Frogger Game : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9fO-YuWPSk

Part 4:
Create classes for each specific object:
• Class for layers
    This class will essentially will have functions that style the layer and add obstacles that would determine the speed of the obstacle, determine if the layer is the ground or not. 
• Class for Barrel
    Create the barrel object that will allow the user to control where it moves, displays the barrel and updates its location, determines if it can attach to an obstacle or gets killed
• Class for Obstacles
    Establishes the conidtions for each of the obstacles, when it moves and how it displays

In my sketch I would bring everything together by calling an array to push the layers together and have functionality with the barrelt to navigate through the page
    

Fifth Step:
Working prototype: I was able to get things to work with simple shapes and and key commands

Beta Version: Reskin the game with my art and fix bugs

Alpha Version: Have a functional game that works with the animations and graphics
